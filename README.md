Dear Students,

Please find the attachments which give details of hands on exercise we are going to do. 
Class Group.xlsx - Give details of division of class in group. Intent here that each group of student will be solving the problem and presenting in class.
I have attached data (household_power_consumption.zip) along with definition of the dataset. We will be using this dataset -
1. to ingest in hadoop or databricks and perform data engineering activities
2. develop prediction algorithm
3. visualization either by tableau or using react framework
